          Our enzyme, Convero, changes the way sugar interacts with the body by
          converting up to 30% of consumed sugar into dietary fiber. This
          results in less sugar uptake and fiber intake that feeds the
          microbiome.

That’s why, at Zya, we prioritise transforming how food is digested—without ever compromising on taste. After all, taste matters. It’s one of the biggest reasons people fail to stick to diets.\L\n\nThe truth is, diets aren’t always the solution you think they are: 95% of all diets fail, with most people either unable to stick to them or regaining the weight they lost.\n"
