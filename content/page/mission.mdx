      Current nutritional offers are riddled with false claims and synthetic
      solutions, while healthier choices are often out of reach for most
      consumers.


      However, improved nutrition is a social good: giving better quality of
      life to individuals and reducing pressures on health and social care for
      wider society.

      Our approach focuses on small, incremental changes accumulating across an
      individual’s diet.


      While our enzymes may be small, their total impact over a lifetime will
      have a transformative effect on people’s health and quality of life.
