We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your Personal Data.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data when making available our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (together, the “**Site**”), as well as associated marketing activities and other activities described in this Privacy Policy. Under the GDPR, we are a ‘controller’ for the activities covered by this Privacy Policy.\n\nFor reference, when we refer to “**Personal Data**”, we mean any information which identifies you as an individual or which otherwise renders you identifiable. When we use the term “**GDPR**”, we are referring to both the so-called UK General Data Protection Regulation (“**UK GDPR**”) and/or the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation\_2016/679 (“**EU GDPR**”) (as and where applicable in the circumstances).\n\n# What Personal Data we collect\n\nThe Personal Data we typically collect about you is outlined in the table below.\n\n| **Category of Personal Data** | **What this means**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Contact Data                  | Your full name and email address.   The organisation you work for or represent (should you provide it to us).                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Communications Data           | Information you exchange with us in your communications with us, plus your preferences relating to our emails.  This includes any Personal Data you provide in any free-text ‘message’ fields via which you can communicate with us on the Site (e.g., using the ‘Contact Us’ functionality). |\n\n**No obligation to provide Personal Data.** You do not have to provide Personal Data to us. However, where we need to process your Personal Data either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Site, and you fail to provide that Personal Data when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all parts of our Site. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.\n\n**Don’t give us sensitive information**. We ask that you do not provide us with any sensitive types of Personal Data (e.g., health-related information, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, criminal convictions information etc) – whether through the Site or otherwise. For example, please do not input any of these types of sensitive information in any free-text ‘message’ fields via which you can communicate with us on the Site (e.g., using the ‘Contact Us’ functionality).\n\n# How we use your Personal Data and why\n\nWe use your Personal Data for the purposes listed below and any associated sharing of Personal Data (see the section called How we share your Personal Data, below).\n\nIn respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a ‘legal basis’ for that use. Our legal bases for processing your Personal Data described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.\n\n* Where we need to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (“**Contractual Necessity**”).\n* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (“**Legitimate Interests**”).\n* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“**Compliance with Law**”).\n* Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question (“**Consent**”).\n\n| **SITE OPERATION**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Purpose**: To provide, operate and secure the Site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| **Categories of Personal Data**:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| -

Provide you with information about our processing of your Personal Data and give you access to your Personal Data.\n* **Correct**. Update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Data.\n* **Delete**. Delete your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it - you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).\n* **Transfer**. Transfer to you or a third party of your choice a machine-readable copy of your Personal Data which you have provided to us.\n* **Restrict**. Restrict the processing of your Personal Data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.\n* **Object**. Object to our processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on Legitimate Interests – you also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.\n* **Withdraw** **Consent**. When we use your Personal Data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.\n\n*Exercising your rights*\n\nTo exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the contact details shown below.\n\nWe may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Whether or not we are required to fulfil any request you make will depend on a number of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your Personal Data), if we reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part) we will let you know our grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions. Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n\n*Timing*\n\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\n# How we share your Personal Data\n\nWe may share your Personal Data with the following categories of recipient and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, in other applicable notices, or at the time of collection.\n\n**Affiliates.** Our subsidiaries and affiliates (from time to time).\n\n**Service providers.** Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate parts of the Site or our business (such as our hosting providers, information technology/security providers, customer support, email delivery, marketing, consumer research and website analytics).\n\n**Professional advisors.** Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.\n\n**Authorities and others.** Law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n**Parties to corporate events**. We may disclose Personal Data in the context of actual or prospective corporate events (e.g., investments in Zya Enzymes, financing of Zya Enzymes, or the sale, transfer or merger of all or part of our business, assets or shares), for example, we may need to share certain Personal Data with prospective counterparties and their advisers. We may also disclose your Personal Data to an acquirer, successor, or assignee of Zya Enzymes as part of any acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, and/or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Data is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.\n\n# Transfers outside Europe\n\nWe may share your Personal Data with third parties who are based outside the UK and European Economic Area (“**Europe**”), including the United States.\n\nWhere we share your Personal Data with third parties who are based outside Europe, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:\n\n* **Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision.** We may transfer your Personal Data to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time) or under specific adequacy frameworks approved by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time), such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.\n* **Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision.**\n  * We may transfer your Personal Data to countries or territories whose laws have **not** been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection (e.g., the United States).\n  * However, in these cases:\n    * we may use specific appropriate safeguards, which are designed to give Personal Data effectively the same protection it has in Europe – for example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorities for this purpose; or\n    * in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your Personal Data to such country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ – for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.\_\n\nYou may contact us using the details below if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data outside of Europe.\n\n# Security\n\nWe employ technical, organisational and physical safeguards designed to protect your Personal Data (including to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed).  For example, we limit access to your Personal Data to only those employees and other staff who have a business need to have such access. All such people are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\n\nIn addition, we have put in place procedures to deal with potential personal data breaches affecting your Personal Data. In the event of any such breach, we have systems in place to notify and work with applicable regulators where required. In addition, in certain circumstances\_(e.g., where we are legally required to do so) we may notify you of more serious personal data breaches affecting your Personal Data.\n\nPlease note that despite the efforts described above, as our Site is hosted electronically, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.\n\n# Retention\n\nWe are committed to only keeping your Personal Data for so long as we reasonably need to use it for the purposes set out above. This general rule applies unless a longer retention period is required by law.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\n\nWhen we no longer require the Personal Data that we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\n# Third party links\n\nThis Site may include links to third party websites, platforms, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share your Personal Data.\n\nWe do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements or practices.
