      #### The status quo


      ## From chemical modification...


      The conventional approach to improving nutrition in processed food focuses
      on reformulated recipes and substituted ingredients.


      The result is unsatisfying food that just does not taste as good.

      #### The Zya way


      ## ...to biological transformation.


      With Zya, what you eat is just the start of the story.


      With the help of naturally-derived enzymes, we can enjoy food we love
      while achieving better nutritional outcomes - after we’ve eaten it.

      #### Our approach


      # With small additions comes better nutrition


      We’re inspired by the extraordinary powers of natural enzymes.


      By harnessing these transformative powers, we make food healthier - at the
      point of digestion.

      #### Our first ingredient


      # From sugar to fiber


      We found an enzyme with a remarkable power: it converts up to 30% of sugar
      into fiber in our gut. That’s less “bad” and more “good” for all of us.
