      #### The status quo


      ## From chemical modification...


      The conventional approach to improving nutrition in processed food focuses
      on reformulated recipes and substituted ingredients.


      The result is unsatisfying food that just doesn’t taste as good.

      ## ...to biological transformation.


      With Zya, what you eat is just the start of the story.


      With the help of naturally-derived enzymes, we can enjoy food we love
      while achieving better nutritional outcomes - after we’ve eaten it.

      #### Our approach


      # With small additions comes better nutrition


      We’re inspired by the extraordinary powers of natural enzymes. By
      harnessing these transformative powers, we make food healthier - at the
      point of digestion.

      #### Our first ingredient


      # From sugar to fiber


      We found an enzyme with a remarkable power: it converts up to 30% of sugar
      into fiber in our gut. That’s less “bad” and more “good” for all of us.
