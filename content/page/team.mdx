          Niels firmly believes that science is a team sport. During his PhD at
          the University of Oxford he worked on functional proteins in the gut
          and became fascinated by the outsized impact of tiny molecular
          changes. At Zya, Niels leads the R\&D program and coordinates Zya’s
          research partners.
